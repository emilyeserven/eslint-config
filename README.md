# eslint-config

Emily's ESLint config.

Designed to be used with [emstack](https://github.com/emilyeserven/emstack?tab=readme-ov-file) but does include configs without the file paths defined as well.

Do note that I threw this together without checking what it _should_ look/be structured like so it's definitely... going to get cleaned up a bit.
